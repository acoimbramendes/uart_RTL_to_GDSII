        : Optimizations such as constant propagation or redundancy removal could change the connections so a hierarchical instance does not drive any primary outputs anymore. To see the list of deleted hierarchical instances, set the 'information_level' attribute to 2 or above. If the message is truncated set the message attribute 'truncate' to false to see the complete list. To prevent this optimization, set the 'delete_unloaded_insts' root/subdesign attribute to 'false' or 'preserve' instance attribute to 'true'.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
